# Battleground
The goal of this project is to simulate the Battlegrounds game mode (in the Hearthstone game) and to simulate thousands of games to train an IA.\n
Currently my program simulates the servant recruitment part. It also simulates 36/40 possible heroes.\n

to do: \n
-Simulate the combat part between players\n
-Learn/create the feature to allow the program to storage/compare its state for practice.\n
-(optional) Create a better view of the simulation.\n

this repository shows the code and can be run with the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.\n

The program does not display the description of the cards/minions used. \n
