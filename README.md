# Battleground
The goal of this project is to simulate the Battlegrounds game mode (in the Hearthstone game) and to simulate thousands of games to train an IA.
Currently my program simulates the whole game. It also simulates 36/40 possible heroes.
A Bot part exists but is not proposed at the launch of the program.(Because its not allow in game)

to simulate the project:
<b>git clone https://github.com/yoan34/Battleground</b>
<b>cd Battleground</b>

create an virtual environnement
<b>python -m venv env</b>

active the virtual environnement
<b>.\env\scripts\activate</b>

install all dependencies:
<b> pip install -r requirements.txt</b>

Run the programme: (only window console, because the programme change the size of the console, only the window console, else you will see an strange output.)
<b>python prog.py</b>
